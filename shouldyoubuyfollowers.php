             <br> You might know your Instagram content is good, but no one is joining your mission. Imagine how much better it will look if 10,000 people agree.
<br>Whether you’re trying to become a social media celebrity or merely looking to spread brand awareness on Instagram, it can seem tempting to pay for your first couple thousand followers.</br>
<br>There are plenty of services available that allow you to buy 1,000 followers for the price of a small Starbucks latte. However, of course, if it were that cheap and easy, everyone would be doing it. So what’s the catch? Is buying Instagram followers legal and safe for your business? Is it a worthwhile investment?</br>
<br>We’ve explored the pros and cons, so you can decide for yourself if it’s a good move for your brand.</br>
 
<br>A lot of bought followers will be bots or inactive accounts. The only website I know of that offers reliable, and real followers are http://followmyass.com/. If you purchase through this website or another that provides similar services, there is no risk to your account. A huge benefit is that it won’t usually be detectable on your account since they are real people.</br>
 
<br>If you go through a different website, that uses bots, you will have these risks and more:</br> <br><b>1) It Might Make You Look, Shady:</b></br>
<br>If your real followers discover many of your likes/followers are fake, you may lose existing or potential customers, who might avoid doing business with you.</br>
<br><b>2) Instagram Will Punish You:</b></br>
<br>If Instagram knows you used bots, they will be removed from your account. Which is why it’s essential to use a trusted website similar to followmyass.com.
Instagram could, in the worst case, restrict your IP address from accessing the Instagram app and website.</br>
<br><b>3) Fake Likes Do Not Equal Real Business:</b></br>
<br>Paid engagement especially if their bots, won’t usually result in real business. They will make your brand appear to be more popular than it is.</br>
<br>Conclusion: There are pros and cons to buying followers. Never use fake websites, but using http://followmyass.com/ is up to you and depends on your social media account’s mission. </br>
